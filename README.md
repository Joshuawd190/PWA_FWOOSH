## Installation

To use locally, clone or download the repo, then npm i to get the dependencies. Run a mongodb instance or service to ensure the database will work.

## Usage

To run locally, npm run start to host the website on localhost3001. In the website, you can add transactions that will either increase or decrease your total funds. The total over time is then tracked in a chart below. This app will work even if the internet is disconnected, it will store the records locally until connection is re-established.
